# Smith School Rankings Scrutiny

To model a database for ranking various UMD Smith School programs, our mission is to provide a user-friendly platform that offers multi-year rankings for various graduate programs. Our goal is to enable the Smith School to draw valuable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making regarding program rankings over the years.  

## **Objectives:** ##
●	To find the top 5 ranked programs over the last 3 years, so that Smith School can display these programs on their website to increase transparency.  
●	To find the top 5 improved/declined programs over the last 3 years to help the Smith School analyze this trend and what changes led to this trend.  
●	To find the top 5 programs with consistent ranking across all ranking sources, so that Smith School can assign singular ranks to these programs irrespective of ranking sources.   
●	To find the top 3 performing degrees in Smith School based on program rankings which can be displayed on the website to provide students/parents with useful information in their research.   
●	To find the proportion of programs that improved/declined over the last year's rankings to help Smith School track the results of their program improvement efforts.
